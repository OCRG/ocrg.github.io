# Getting Started with OCRG

Welcome to the Ozark Cybersecurity Research Group! This guide will help you get started with our projects and resources.

## Introduction

OCRG is dedicated to advancing cybersecurity through innovative research in threat detection and security techniques. Our open-source projects focus on steganalysis, threat detection, and other cybersecurity domains.

## Join Our Community

The first step in getting involved with OCRG is to join our community:

1. **Discord:** Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/6SDUxJzSdr) to connect with researchers, developers, and other community members.
2. **GitHub:** Follow us on [GitHub](https://github.com/OCRG) to access our repositories and contribute to our projects.

## Explore Our Research

To understand our current focus areas:

1. Review our [Steganalysis Research](../research/steganalysis.md) to learn about our work in hidden data detection.
2. Explore our [Threat Detection Research](../research/threat-detection.md) to understand our approaches to cybersecurity threat identification.

## Contributing to OCRG Projects

If you're interested in contributing to our projects:

1. Read our [Contributing Guide](contributing.md) for guidelines on code standards, pull requests, and development workflow.
2. Follow our [Development Best Practices](dev-best-practices.md) to understand our approach to coding and version control.
3. Check our GitHub repositories for issues labeled "good first issue" to find beginner-friendly tasks.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Prerequisites

For most OCRG projects, you'll need:

- Git for version control
- Python 3.8+ for data science and machine learning projects
- Node.js for web-based tools and interfaces

### Basic Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository** of the project you want to work on:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OCRG/[repository-name].git
   cd [repository-name]
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (for Python projects):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # For Python projects
   # OR
   npm install  # For Node.js projects
   ```

4. **Run tests** to ensure everything is working:
   ```bash
   pytest  # For Python projects
   # OR
   npm test  # For Node.js projects
   ```

## Resources for Beginners

If you're new to cybersecurity or machine learning, here are some resources to help you get started:

- **Cybersecurity Fundamentals:** [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)
- **Machine Learning:** [Scikit-learn Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html)
- **Deep Learning:** [TensorFlow Tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials)
- **Git and GitHub:** [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/)

## Next Steps

After getting familiar with our projects and community:

1. **Choose a project** that aligns with your interests and skills
2. **Start small** by fixing simple issues or improving documentation
3. **Engage with the community** by asking questions and sharing ideas
4. **Develop your own ideas** for new features or projects
