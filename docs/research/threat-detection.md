# Threat Detection Research

## Overview

Our threat detection research focuses on developing advanced systems capable of identifying, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity threats in real-time. We leverage cutting-edge machine learning and AI techniques to create adaptive frameworks that can detect both known and emerging threats across various digital environments.

## Research Challenges

Modern threat detection faces several significant challenges:

1. **Evolving Threat Landscape:** Cyber threats constantly evolve, requiring detection systems that can adapt to new attack vectors and techniques.
2. **False Positives:** Traditional detection systems often generate excessive false positives, creating alert fatigue and overlooking real threats.
3. **Encrypted Traffic:** Increasing use of encryption makes traditional packet inspection ineffective.
4. **Resource Constraints:** Many organizations have limited computational resources for advanced threat detection.
5. **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs):** Sophisticated attackers employ stealthy techniques designed to evade detection for extended periods.

## Our Approach

At OCRG, we're addressing these challenges through several innovative research directions:

### Self-supervised Anomaly Detection

We're exploring frameworks that:

- Learn normal patterns from unlabeled data
- Detect deviations without requiring examples of every threat type
- Continuously adapt to changing environments and behaviors

### Behavioral Analysis

Our research focuses on:

- Analyzing patterns of behavior rather than simply matching signatures
- Building comprehensive behavior profiles for users, systems, and networks
- Detecting subtle deviations that may indicate compromise

### Multimodal Threat Intelligence

We're developing systems that:

- Integrate and correlate data from multiple sources
- Apply contextual analysis to reduce false positives
- Generate actionable intelligence from raw security data

## Current Projects

### Adaptive Network Anomaly Detection

This project aims to develop a framework that continuously learns normal network behavior patterns and identifies anomalies that may indicate security threats, without requiring signatures of specific attacks.

### Contextual Security Event Analysis

We're researching methods to analyze security events in context, correlating multiple data points to distinguish between benign anomalies and actual threats.

### Lightweight Endpoint Protection

This project focuses on developing threat detection techniques that can operate effectively on resource-constrained endpoints while maintaining high detection rates.

## Future Directions

Our roadmap includes:

- Incorporating federated learning for privacy-preserving threat detection
- Developing explainable AI approaches for security analysts
- Exploring real-time threat mitigation through automated response systems
- Creating frameworks for detecting threats in IoT and embedded systems

## Collaboration Opportunities

We're seeking collaborators interested in:

- Developing and testing new threat detection algorithms
- Creating realistic evaluation environments and datasets
- Implementing practical threat detection solutions
- Researching novel approaches to emerging threat categories
