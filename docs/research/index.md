## Research Methodology

Our research approach combines:

- **Self-supervised Learning:** Training models on unlabeled data to reduce dependence on manually annotated datasets.
- **Contrastive Learning:** Helping models distinguish between normal and anomalous patterns through comparative analysis.
- **Cross-domain Adaptability:** Ensuring our techniques work effectively across different data types and sources.
- **Computational Efficiency:** Optimizing algorithms to operate effectively with limited computational resources.

## Current Projects

We're in the early stages of several research projects:

1. **Invariant Steganalysis Framework:** Developing techniques that can detect steganography regardless of the cover medium's characteristics.
2. **Real-time Threat Pattern Recognition:** Building systems that can identify emerging threats through pattern analysis.
3. **Open-source Detection Tools:** Creating accessible tools for organizations to enhance their security posture.
