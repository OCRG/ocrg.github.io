# About OCRG

## Our Organization

The **Ozark Cybersecurity Research Group (OCRG)** is a non-profit organization focused on advancing the field of cybersecurity through cutting-edge research and open-source collaborations. Founded with a vision to enhance digital security through innovative approaches to threat detection and analysis, OCRG brings together researchers, professionals, and enthusiasts passionate about cybersecurity.

## Vision & Mission

**Vision:** A digital world where advanced cybersecurity techniques are accessible to all, ensuring a safer online environment through collaborative research and open innovation.

**Mission:** To advance cybersecurity through innovative research in threat detection and security techniques, leveraging cutting-edge machine learning and AI methodologies to design robust systems for identifying hidden threats and mitigating cyber risks.

## Our Approach

At OCRG, we believe that the future of cybersecurity lies at the intersection of traditional security approaches and advanced computational techniques:

- **Self-Supervised Learning:** Developing models that can learn from unlabeled data, reducing the need for extensive manual annotation.
- **Contrastive Learning:** Using techniques that help models understand similarities and differences between data points to better detect anomalies.
- **Cross-Domain Adaptability:** Creating frameworks that work effectively across different types of data and threat scenarios.
- **Open Collaboration:** Sharing our research, tools, and findings with the broader community to foster innovation and improvement.

## Current Focus Areas

### Advanced Steganalysis
We're researching self-supervised contrastive learning approaches for detecting hidden data in digital media. Our focus is on developing techniques that are invariant across diverse cover sources, making detection more robust against sophisticated hiding methods.

### Threat Detection Frameworks
We're building adaptive AI frameworks for real-time detection and analysis of emerging cyber threats. These frameworks aim to identify patterns and anomalies that might indicate potential security breaches or vulnerabilities.

### Open-Source Security Tools
We're developing and contributing to open-source tools that help organizations and individuals better protect their digital assets and information.
